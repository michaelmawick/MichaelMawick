# 👋 Hello, I'm Michael!

I'm a 16-year-old self-taught developer from Germany with a deep passion for programming and building things that work. I wrote my very first lines of code back in **2021**, starting with a small Minecraft plugin in **Java** — and I’ve been hooked ever since.

Since then, I’ve been constantly learning, experimenting, and improving my skills. In **June 2024**, I reached a big milestone: I launched and now run my **own server**, but it didn't hold that long, after 2 months i've closed it due to financal problems.

## 🛠️ What I Work With

Here are the main languages and tools I’m currently using:

- **Java** – My first language and still one of my favorites  
- **Kotlin** – Clean, modern, and powerful  
- **Python** – Great for scripts, bots, and quick prototyping  
- **HTML, CSS/TailwindCSS & JavaScript** – For web development  
- **Godot Engine** – Creating games and interactive experiences with GDScript
